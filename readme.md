# Good to Know
- The swagger is on this address: http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/
- You can change some configuration by `.env` file
- The keys in keys directory can be replaced by your own private and public keys which should be generated by `RS256` algorithm. These keys are used to encode and decode JWT tokens. If you want to verify tokens in other services (especially *notification service*), you can use the public keys to decode tokens as the first step of token validation.
